-👋 Hi, I’m Yamank —an aspiring Full Stack Web Developer on a coding adventure!

-👀 I’m all about tech and love turning code into cool, interactive web experiences.

-🌱 Right now, I’m deep in the world of web development, learning everything from front-end flair to back-end brilliance.

-💞️ I’m excited to team up on projects that make the web more awesome—whether it's creating sleek designs or powerful back-end systems.

-📫 Reach out to me anytime—I'm just a message away!

-😄 Pronouns: He/Him (but I also answer to “Hey, coder!”)

-⚡ Fun fact: When I'm not coding, I'm probably trying to automate something in my life—or teaching my coffee machine new tricks!
